        <h2 class="intro__title">What didn't we see there?</h2>
        <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM(All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center) surveys,
            95% of Russians dream of traveling somewhere, yet only 36% plan to spend their vacation within
            their homeland. Many ponder, "What have we not seen here at home?" In reality, Russia is an unto
            the universe itself, with the gentle seas of the south, the dense forests of the Sayans,
            and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. Moreover, witnessing these beauties doesn't
            require millions in the bank, a passport, or enduring long flights. Take, for example,
            Vera Bashmakova—a daring young mother who gathered her three children, placed them in her
            Lada(car brand) and traveled 20,000 kilometers across her homeland.
            We've selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.

                    Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
                    First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge,
                    you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
                    And if you open the windows in your car, you can meet
                    with the invisible miracle of these places - the mountain air.

                <p class="place__paragraph">
                    The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in the summer.
                    This way you will see all the diversity of local flora and fauna.
                    Elks roam through the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges,
                    and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous Pallas' cat is also an inhabitant of the Altai
                    region.

                    Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake
                    in the world. Many also know that it is the largest source of fresh water
                    and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.

                <p class="place__paragraph">
                    Of course, this is all true.
                    But Baikal is also an ideal place for skioring competitions.
                    This is a sport where the skier ties himself
                    to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice.
                    In March 2019, a world record was set at the Baikal Mile festival - 197.011
                    km/h

                    Because of the impassable swamps, the parks never knew the axe. Some pine trees

                    than Ivan the Terrible(16th century) saw him.
                    In a virgin forest you won’t find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on rare paths there are
                    trees
